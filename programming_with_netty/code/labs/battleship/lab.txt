Game of battleships - a simplified version.

The server will allow only two players to connect.

Each client when it start up, allows user to select locations to place their 
ships (on a grid of 10 x 10 - letter x number.

Each ship occupied only one cell on the grid. Each player places 10 ships.

Each client remembers locations of its ships and locations where you bombed on
the opponents side. Hits are marked and misses are marked also.

Game ends when one of the player hits all the opponents ships.

Create a Cell class which has a letter and a number. When you bomb a cell, pass
the Cell instance to the server. The server will pass a cell instance to the other client.

The client will reply back with a cell if it was hit or not.
